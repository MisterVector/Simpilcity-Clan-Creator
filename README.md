# Project Is Indefinitely On Hold

Due to changes made by Blizzard that have severely impacted Warcraft III support by third parties, there is
currently no way forward that I can see for this program. As such, this project is effectively on hold
indefinitely. In fact, it no longer works anymore.

# Simplicity Clan Creator

Simplicity Clan Creator is a clan creator for Warcraft III that automatically creates clans with 10 working
Warcraft III keys. It works using SOCKS4 and HTTP proxies. It will automatically scan for non-clanned keys
until it finds 10 non-clanned keys that it can distribute between a chieftain and 9 initiates.

# What is this extra/ doing in .gitignore?

The reason that .gitignore has an entry called `extra/` is so you can create a folder called "extra" in your
own local git repository with its own content that you don't want to be a part of the repository as you may
want to create tools that can assist your development or store project assets.
